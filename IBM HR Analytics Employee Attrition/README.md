# HR Employee Attrition Analysis & Interactive Dashboard

---

## üìù Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition using the IBM HR dataset. The primary goal is to identify the key factors that lead to employee turnover and to build an interactive Power BI dashboard that allows the HR department to explore these insights. By understanding the root causes of attrition, the company can develop targeted strategies to improve employee retention.

##  workflow

1.  **Data Extraction & Initial Exploration (SQL):** The analysis began in a SQL environment. The `HR_Attrition.sql` script contains queries used to perform initial data aggregation and exploration to understand the basic structure and patterns in the dataset.

2.  **In-Depth Analysis (Python):** The Jupyter Notebook `HR_Attrition_ANALYSIS .IPYNB` was used for a deeper dive. This step involved:
    * Loading the dataset using the **Pandas** library.
    * Performing data cleaning and preparation.
    * Conducting detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover correlations and initial insights into attrition drivers.

3.  **Dashboard Creation (Power BI):** The final step was to create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard using Power BI. The `.pbix` file connects to the clean data to visualize the key findings. The dashboard allows users to dynamically filter and slice the data to explore attrition trends across different demographics and factors.

## üí° Key Insights & Recommendations

* **Overtime is a Major Factor:** Employees who work overtime have a significantly higher attrition rate. **Recommendation:** HR should review workload distribution and overtime policies to mitigate burnout.
* **Job Satisfaction is Critical:** There is a strong negative correlation between job satisfaction and attrition. **Recommendation:** Implement regular employee feedback mechanisms and invest in employee engagement initiatives.
* **High-Risk Roles:** Sales Representatives show the highest attrition rates among all job roles. **Recommendation:** Develop targeted career pathing and mentoring programs for the Sales team.
